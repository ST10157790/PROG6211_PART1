Open Visual Studio.
Click on "Open a project or solution" on the start screen or go to "File" > "Open" > "Project/Solution".
Navigate to the folder where you have the RecipeApp code stored and select the project file 
(usually with a .csproj extension) and click "Open".
Once the project is loaded, 
make sure the RecipeApp project is selected as 
the startup project. You can right-click on the RecipeApp 
project in the Solution Explorer and choose "Set as StartUp Project" if it's not already set.
Press F5 or click on the "Start" button in the toolbar to build and run the application.
A console window will open, and you can interact with the application by following
 the prompts and entering the required information.

Note: Ensure that you have the necessary version of the .NET Framework installed on your machine to run the application.
